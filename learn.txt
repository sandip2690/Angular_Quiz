Please note that you're trying to get access to your factory from the HTML view.

This is impossible in AngularJS.

You have to bind entities to the $scope in your controller. And then you get access to the entities in your views through the $scope.

The $scope is the glue between controller and view in AngularJS. This pattern is close to MVVM in .NET technologies like Silverlight or WPF ...
